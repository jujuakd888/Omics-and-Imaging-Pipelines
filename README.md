# Omics-and-Imaging-Pipelines
Built a reproducible R Markdown pipeline (tidyverse, ggplot2, pheatmap, survival) to analyse TCGA-style breast cancer data: tumour-vs-normal testing (Wilcoxon + FDR), heatmaps, volcano plots, and Kaplanâ€“Meier curves; delivered cleaned CSV outputs and figures to a shared GitHub repo.
